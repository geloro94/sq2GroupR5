# sq2GroupR5
The Strucutured Query V2 Format was developed in the MII ABIDE project as an intermediate query language for CQL and FHIR Search with the potential to support further query languages in the long term. In HL7 FHIR there are efforts to refine the Group Resource in R5 to express inclusion and exclusion criteria. To verify the expressiveness of Structured Queries V2 in this refined Resource this script translates SQ to Group.
